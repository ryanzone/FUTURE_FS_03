## ❌ Problem

The gym did not have a professional website and relied mainly on walk-in customers and word-of-mouth marketing.

Because of this:

- Customers could not easily find gym details online
- Timings, services, and location were unclear
- The business had limited online visibility
- Trust and professionalism were reduced

---

## ✅ Solution

I designed and developed a modern, mobile-friendly website that provides:

- Clear information about gym services and programs
- Professional brand appearance
- Image gallery of facilities
- Google Maps location integration
- Direct Call and WhatsApp enquiry buttons
- Responsive design for all devices

- Increases membership enquiries
- Helps the gym compete with larger fitness brands
